There are mornings that remind you exactly why you lace up your boots and hit the trail. Last Saturday was one of those mornings. I set out just before dawn from the eastern trailhead, the air sharp and clean, carrying the faint scent of pine resin and damp earth. Within the first mile, the canopy broke open to reveal a staggering view of the valley below, still blanketed in a thin layer of mist.

The trail climbed steadily through dense stands of spruce and birch, crossing a pair of wooden footbridges over ice-cold streams fed by snowmelt. By mid-morning I had gained enough elevation that the landscape shifted dramatically—the trees thinned out, the air grew cooler, and wide alpine meadows stretched ahead with patches of wildflowers clinging to the rocky terrain.

The highlight of the day, though, came when I was resting near a rocky outcrop about two-thirds of the way up. A flash of russet fur caught my eye at the edge of the tree line. A fox—quick, cautious, and utterly unbothered by my presence at that distance—was trotting along the meadow, nose low to the ground, hunting for breakfast. I scrambled for my phone and managed to snap a shot before it disappeared into the brush. The photo is not going to win any awards (you can barely make it out), but it captures the moment perfectly.

From the summit, the panorama was breathtaking: ridge after ridge fading into blue haze, a hawk circling lazily on a thermal, and the distant glint of a lake I had never noticed on the map. I sat up there for a good half-hour, eating trail mix and feeling genuinely grateful for legs that still carry me up mountains.

The descent was gentle and unhurried. I took a different route back, looping through a section of old-growth forest where the trees stood impossibly tall and the light filtered down in golden columns. By the time I reached the car, I had logged just over fourteen miles and felt that particular kind of tired that is more satisfaction than exhaustion.

If you have been putting off that hike, let this be your sign. The mountains are waiting, and apparently, so are the foxes.
